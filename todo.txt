KRNOGRAFI TO DO

 - touch only opens timespan if it is currently wider than 300px
 - OR touch zooms in on timespan so that it fills viewport
 - OR is this double touch?


 - Images and short desc for open timeSpan
 - Button to move to timespan extended view mode (filling viewport with large images and full desc)

 - Add earliestStart and latestEnd bars*DONE


 - fix jitteriness in pinch zoom

 - data model in database
 - database connection
 - my timelines panel
 - multiple rows in timeLine to accommodate multiple simultaneous events
 - images loaded from data
      - works but only for remote URLs. Local image paths WAY too weird (ReactNative issue)
- more recent time periods <1 MYA
- time ruler adds smaller increments as viewport widens
  -added functionality but error at certain zoom level: 'array size is not a small enough positive integer'
- TimeSpan labels running into each other horizontally

- keep timeLine and TimeSpan labels displaying after scrolling left (make the labels float)
    -TimeLine labels working but a little clunky on the vertical zoom: there's a problem with calling scrollView.scrollTo() from MainView refs (fails silently)
    - not yet implemented in timeSpans
